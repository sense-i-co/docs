## Product Classification Overview
___ 

Information about Products is stored at **four levels of detail** in the Sense-i System.  

At the top level, **Resources** are
assigned to **"Categories"** such as Products, Materials, Machines,
Facilities and so on.

Each Category is broken down into **"Groups"**.  

Each Group is further broken down into **"Types"**.

Each Type consists of actual **"Product Profiles"** or instances of
specific Products.

The Categories, Groups and Types are simply ways of arranging and storing information in the Sense-i database to make it easier to search for specific items from the entire list of everything that the company buys and sells.  

The actual Products that your company sells to its customers are called **Product Profiles**.  

Product Profiles are **instances of specific products** that appear in
the **Product Catalogue** _(also known as Price Lists)_ and are used on **Sales Orders**, **Sales Delivery Notes**, **Sales Tax Invoices** and so on.

The following diagram illustrates these classification levels.
