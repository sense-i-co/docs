## Introduction & Overview
___

The Internal Order Management Process contains all the functions you
need to process all the internal orders that occur between the various
branches and departments within the company.  

It allows one department to order products or services from another, and where physical goods are involved, will track the movement of those goods from one branch to another.  

The process also includes all the reports you need to review
the performance and to-do actions required to keep on top of all the
transactions that occur between the branches or departments in your
company.  

The functions in the Internal Order Management module can be best
described in the following flowchart.

You can access the step-by-step guides and video demonstrations for each function from the list below.  

:::note Terms: Process & Module  

We use the term "**Process**" to describe the work that must be done in a specific area of your business and the term "**Module**" to refer to the set of functions in the Sense-i software that allows you to perform
that work.  

:::

:::note Background Information
To better understand the flowchart please read the **Business PowerPoint, Levels of Work,** and **Understanding Function Types** documents.  

These documents provide essential background information to understanding how the work and information in your business and the Sense-i system is structured.

:::  

:::note

There are several variations of this process, and within each, also several different ways a function or step in the process can be performed. Each industry has a unique set of rules and procedures that implement the best way to achieve a result.  

While the process flowchart above might look simple, the unique requirements for the industry and for each company are implemented in each of the functions in the Sense-i system.
