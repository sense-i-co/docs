<hr>
<p>The key role of any person who has been appointed to handle
<strong>Material Procurement</strong> is to ensure that the correct materials are available in
the <strong>correct quantity</strong>, at the <strong>correct quality</strong> and the <strong>correct cost</strong> when
they are needed by the Production Team. If any of the first three
measures are not achieved then the Production Team will suffer
down-time, not be able to achieve their productivity targets and not
be able to complete orders on time. The losses suffered as a result of
a Purchase Order being delivered late from a supplier are large and
must be avoided at all times.</p>
<p>One of the ways in which you can influence this outcome is to
<strong>monitor outstanding Purchase Orders</strong> and to <strong>contact</strong> each supplier to <strong>remind</strong>
them that they have one or more Purchase Orders they must deliver.</p>
<p>The Sense-i system automatically maintains a list of all items ordered
from Suppliers that have not yet been delivered. This list makes it
extremely easy for you to keep track of what items suppliers need to
deliver.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the <strong>Supplier</strong> option on the main menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then click the <strong>Purchase Orders Outstanding</strong> option on the drop-down
menu list.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image2-f1f408cab3d7c271d4c3c8d931099d05.jpg" width="262" height="232" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The system will display a screen titled <strong>Purchase Orders Outstanding</strong>.</p>
<p>This screen lists all the materials and other items that have been
ordered from Suppliers that have not yet been received at the time of
opening the screen. This screen provides the most simple, direct and
fastest way of keeping track on what items have been ordered.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image3-c0107f82d39a218bdfd2b682ee63295a.jpg" width="1323" height="401" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The default search criteria are the From Date and To Date and the
system will display all Purchase Orders THAT ARE DUE TO BE DELIVERED
within the From and To Date range. You can change these dates and
enter any other information into the search fields to change the list
of transactions that are displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>Any items in this list that has a Due Date earlier than today&#x27;s date
is late. The system displays the lead time, that is the time taken
between when the order was placed and the current date in the Lead
Time column. If the Lead Time is negative, then the order is not yet
late. If on the other hand the lead time is positive, then the order
is late.</p>
<p>In the system this could be late for one of two reasons. The first
might be that the supplier has actually delivered the item on time but
that the stores did not capture this supplier delivery in the system.
You should treat this as a serious problem because it means that the
stores personnel are not doing capturing transactions as they occur,
and this has a negative impact on you because you will be wasting your
time and the company&#x27;s money by trying to find out what the status of
an order is manually, and it has a negative impact on Accounting
(because important information about money the company owes the
supplier is not captured, and so cash-flows will be inaccurate) and on
Production, because the stock information will not be correct. You
must make sure you resolve this issue. See guideline for &quot;Not
Capturing Supplier Deliveries&quot; for suggestions on how to handle this
problem.</p>
<p>The second reason is that the supplier has not delivered the ordered
items when they are due and is late on fulfilling Purchase Orders.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>To make it easier to use the list, you can group the information in
the list in various ways.<br>
<!-- -->Right click with the mouse
pointer floating over the grid and select <strong>Grid Layout</strong> and then click on <strong>Enable Groups</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image5-fe2a980e756d965ec9333f246269aadd.jpg" width="494" height="168" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<p>Then drag the <strong>Due Week</strong> column heading up into the grey bar and click
the on the <strong>Due Date</strong> column to sort all items in the list from
earliest to latest Due Date within each week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is also useful to drag the <strong>Supplier Name</strong> into the grey bar
underneath the <strong>Due Week</strong> block to arrange the information about all
Outstanding Purchase Orders first by Due Week and then by Supplier
Name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To view the details of the information in each group, simply click
the <strong>&quot;+&quot; sign</strong> next to the group you wish to expand.<br>
<!-- -->The system will
then show all the rows underneath the group you have chosen to
expand. Depending on how many groups or levels you have arranged in
your report, you may need to click the <strong>&quot;+&quot;</strong> for several levels before
you see the details of the actual order items that are still
outstanding.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Arranging the information in this way should enable you to easily keep
track of and follow-up on all the items that Suppliers must deliver in
each of the weeks. Ideally, you should be following up with Suppliers
for each item <strong>a week in advance</strong>.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/image7-37501dfc554ee6b5222864651acc88d8.jpg" width="1238" height="518" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p>Once you have established that the items on your list are in fact
still outstanding, you need to contact the supplier for the first
order listed on the screen and find out what the status of the order
is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also limit the list of information that is displayed by
entering specific criteria in the <strong>Search Criteria</strong> panel.<br>
<!-- -->If you want
to find all Purchase Orders linked to a specific Job or
<strong>Process Order Number</strong> and this number was entered into the Purchase Order
Reference field, then type this number in this field and click the
<strong>Search</strong> button on the form bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can export all the information in the grid into a spreadsheet,
simply right click the mouse on the grid and select the <strong>&quot;Export&quot;</strong>
option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have completed reviewing the Outstanding Purchase Orders,
click the <strong>Close</strong> button on the form bar.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>When following up with Suppliers on Outstanding Purchase Orders, you
might find that you need to move a Purchase Order to a later date if
you have established that it will not be delivered on time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Note the <strong>Purchase Order Number</strong> you need to move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then select <strong>Supplier</strong> on the main Navigation Menu and click on the <strong>Purchase Order</strong> option in the drop-down menu list.</p>

<p>The system will open a screen titled <strong>Maintain Purchase Order</strong>.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>Enter the number of the Purchase Order in the <strong>Transaction No</strong> field
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>Search</strong> button on the Form Bar.</p>

<p>The system will pop up a small floating window called the <strong>&quot;Change Due Date&quot;</strong> window.</p>

<p>Change the date to be the new date that the supplier has promised
you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>Save</strong> and then the <strong>Close</strong> button on the window.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The system will change the due date on the Purchase Order.</p>
<p><strong>Repeat steps 1 to 7 above once for each Purchase Order in the list.</strong></p>
<p>If the supplier asks you to send them details of the Purchase Order go
to the Standard Operating Procedure titled &quot;Print Purchase Orders.&quot;</p>

affected. This is going to cause us down-time in the factory and
