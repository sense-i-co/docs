## Entities - Overview  

When making decisions about what information you need to work with, it
helps to understand something called "ENTITIES."  

An **"ENTITY"** is an object that exists in the real world.  
Domains relate to things such as;

### Party / Person or Company    

-   Customer  

-   Supplier  

-   Employee  

-   Department  

### Resources / Physical Objects or Services  

-   **Item**, _e.g. a **Product**, **Material** or **Machine**_.

### Transactions 

-   Quote  

-   Order  

-   Delivery Note  

-   Job Card  

-   Receipt  

-   Invoice, and so on.  

**This is the end of the "Entities pertaining to Lists & Grids" section.**
