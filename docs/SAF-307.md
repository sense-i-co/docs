- All materials for all the process orders scheduled for this department on this date make up the Order Quantity and Outstanding Quantities.
- The existing provisional purchases orders are summed and shown in the Provisional Supply column. This means that we can begin to build purchase orders from each day's requirements and only activate the orders when we are ready.
- The colour coding alerts us to negative stock or surplus stock.
