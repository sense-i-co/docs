## Introduction
___ 

This module relates to the workflow used to define, add, view and maintain **certificates** and **documents** relevant to specific parties.  
The term **Certificates** will be used broadly throughout this guideline and includes relevant and associated **Documents**. 

In this guideline, we will focus on the process of adding and maintaining certificates for **Employees** / Contractors.  

:::note  
The same principles and procedures should be used when **defining**, **adding**, **viewing** and **maintaining** certificates relevant to other parties - **Customers**, **Suppliers**, **Financiers**, and **Legislators**.  
:::  

Before adding certificates & documents relevant to employees, there are a few settings (prerequisites) that need to be in place.  

These include;
-   **Directory Settings for Employee Document folders**  

-   **Employee Certificate Folder**  
    The directories and folders above should preferrably shared with relevant colleagues, SEMS users and/or management of the company - this could be a shared **Local Area Network** (LAN) directory or shared **cloud based folders** (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive etc.)  

-   **Certificate Definition and Rules**  
    By default the SEMS system lists 3 Certificate Definitions under the **Personal Group**;
    - Curriculum Vitae (CV)  
    - Identity Documnet (ID)  
    - Passport  
    In the subsequent step-by-step guidelines, the procedures for adding further Certificate Definitions and associated rules are described.  

Once the pre-requisite settings are in place, Certificate records and associated documents can be added for individual employees.

## Step-by-step Guideline

### Prerequisites - Directory Settings   

1.  Select the **Tools** option from the Main Navigation Menu.  

2.  Then click on **Directory Setting**.

3.  The system will open a screen titled **"Directory Setting"**.  
    This screen **lists all the Directories & Folders** relevant to each party.  
    
    Here we will define the Employee Document & Certificate Folder Directory paths.

4.  In the **Party Document Folder** section, click on the **three-dot button** in the **Employee Directory** field.

5.  Select the shared network **Drive** _(LAN drive or cloud based storage drive)_.

:::note  
In this instance we have selected **D:\Company\Employee** as displayed in the **Directory Name** field.  
:::  

7.  Click the **OK** button.

8.  In the **Party Certificate Folder** section, click on the **three-dot button** in the **Employee Certificate Directory** field.

### Certificate Definition and Rules  

The following Step-by-step guideline describes the process of **viewing**, **adding** and **maintaining** **Certificate Definitions** for all parties in the SEMS system.  

1.  Select the **Setup** option from the Main Navigation menu.  

2.  Click on **Certificate Definition** from the Drop-down menu.  
	
![](../static/img/docs/CRT-001/image06.png)  

The **Certificate Definition List** screen is displayed.
	
![](../static/img/docs/CRT-001/image07.png)  

Initially the SEMS system lists 3 Certificate Definitions under the **Personal Group**;
- Curriculum Vitae (CV)  
- Identity Documnet (ID)  
- Passport  

In this exercise we will be adding another Certificate Definition and apply the appropriate rules.  

:::info   
We will be adding a **Matric Certificate** record for a specific employee in the next stage.  
Thus the reason for definining an additional Certificate with relevant rules.  
:::

3.  Click the **Add Items** button on the Form bar.
	
![](../static/img/docs/CRT-001/image08.png)  

The **Add New Certificate** screen is displayed.
	
![](../static/img/docs/CRT-001/image09.png)  

4. Capture an appropriate Certificate Definition Code in the **Certificate Def Code** field.  

:::note Assigning an Appropriate Certificate Definition Code  
In this instance the code **EDU-NQF4-NSC** is used...  
**EDU**, an abbrviation for **Education**  
**NQF4** - **National Qualification Framework, Level 4**  
**NSC** - **National Senior Certificate**  
:::  

5.  Complete the **Certificate Definition Name** field.  

6.  Choose the relevant option from the **Certificate Group** drop-down menu.  

:::info Optional Fields  
The **Use Rating** checkbox, together with the **Min Rating** and **Max Rating** fields are used when you need to apply different values / weights to the same type of certificates.   
In the case of Matric Certificates, some candidates will have different results and / or subjects when compared to others.  This can be useful from a management perspective when deciding which employees are better suited for a specific **task** or **project**.  
:::  

7.  Once the primary Certificate Definition fields have been completed, click the **Save** button.
	
![](../static/img/docs/CRT-001/image11.png)  

8.  Once saved, the Certificate Definition **Rules** can be applied by selecting / de-selecting the relevant checkboxes;
-   Need Issue Date
-   Need Expiry Date (in those cases where a certificate is only valid for a certain period of time, _e.g. drivers license_.)  
-   Need Issuer (where more than one authority supplies the same type of certificate)  
-   Need Certificate Number
-   Unique Certificate No.  
	
![](../static/img/docs/CRT-001/image12.png)  

In the example above, those rules relevant to a Matric Certificate were selected.  

9.  Once you are satisfied that all the information is correct, click on the **Save** button and then **Activate** the record.  

10. The Certificate Definition & Rules screen can now be **Closed**.

The Certificate Definition List screen now displayes the newly added Definition.

![](../static/img/docs/CRT-001/image13.png)  

Repeat the above procedure to add further Certificate Definitions.  

:::important  
The Certificate Definition needs to be **Deactivated** before amendments can be made.  This is also true for those definitions that need to be deleted / removed.  
:::

:::impotant  
At this satge of the procedure, it is neccessary to **copy** or **move** and/or **save** the employee document files to the newly created sub-directory.

8.  Select and **Open** the certificate / document file from Windows File Manager using the associated application.  

![](../static/img/docs/CRT-001/image32.png)  

9.  Use this for reference to enable the capture of information to the SEMS system.  

![](../static/img/docs/CRT-001/image40.png)  

:::tip  
If your computer system has a dual screen setup, it is recommended that the certificate/document file is displayed on one screen, while the SEMS application is active on the other screen.  

Alternatively, the two applications could be displayed side-by-side on a single screen setup.  

Another option would be to **"ALT + TAB"** between the two applications.  
:::  

10. In the SEMS application, click on the **Add** button on the Form Bar of the Certificates Tab in the Employee screen.
