## Introduction  
___

The procedure of defining Task Code Costs should be performed <u>after</u> Task Codes have been defined.  Refer to the document titled **["Define Task Codes"](https://sense-i.co/docs/TSKCDE001)**.  

Next, you need to define the **default rates** that the company will charge **for each of the tasks** that are performed.  

Through a setting at either the **Company Settings** or **Department** function, you can control how the company charges for tasks.  Either they don’t charge for specific tasks and the cost of tasks is built into the Product Price, or they charge for tasks with the price per task determined either at the **Company level**, the **Department level**, the **Task Level** or based on the **Employee** performing the task.  

## Navigate to Task Rates  

To set Task Rates:  

1.  Click **Planning** on the main navigation menu, then  

2.  Click **Task Rates** on the drop-down menu.

## Enter Task Rates  

1.  Click on the record row for which you need to enter Task Rates.  

2.  Enter the default Labour Cost Per Minute, Machine Cost Per Minute and Overhead Cost Per Minute in the **Labour Rate**, **Machine Rate** and **Overhead Rate** columns.  

![](../static/img/docs/TSKCOST-001/enter-rates.gif)  

The system will then sum these three rates you have entered and display the Total Cost Per Hour in the **Total Cost** column.  

3.  Enter a **Markup %** to be applied to the Total Cost for each Task.  

The system will then display the **Total Selling Price** for the Task Code in the **Selling Price** column.  

:::note  
How you company charges for the tasks that are performed by its employees will be largely based on your region and industry.  

Some industries, like vehicle repairs, medicine, advertising and law, will charge at the Employee level based on the actual time taken.  
Other industries, such as manufacturing, will set a fixed price per task and build the cost of the tasks into the final product price.
