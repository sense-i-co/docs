## Procedure Guideline
___  

This procedure explains how to **search** for, **select**, **add** and
**change** customers in the Sense-i Enterprise Management System.

1.  Click **Customer** on the Main Navigation Menu.

2.  Select the **Customer** option from the Drop-down Menu.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-1202/image1.jpg)  

The system will display a screen titled **Maintain Customer Profile**.
This screen lists all the companies classified as Customers in the
system. At the top of this screen is a panel consisting of two rows
and the bottom a grid of many rows containing customer information.  

### Customer Search

The top panel is called the "**Search Criteria**" panel and it enables
you to enter partial information about a Customer and then to instruct
the system to find all records that match the information you have
entered.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-1202/image3.jpg)  

3.  To find all customers that contain the letters "*Mod*" in their name
    you can type the **%** symbol and then the letters "***mod***" in
    the Name fields and then...  

4.  Select the **Search** Button on the Menu Bar.  

### Add Customer

1.  If you cannot find the Customer you wish to use, Click the **Add**
    Button on the Menu Bar.  

2.  The system will display a screen titled **Add New Customer** on top
    of the list of Customers already captured in the system.  

This screen provides a series of blank fields that will enable you to
record basic information about the Customer, such as their **Name**,
their **Registered Name**, **Registration Number**, **Tax Number** and
**Contact** details.

3.  First you will need to define whether the Customer Profile you are
    about to add is for a "**Person**" or an "**Organisation**."  

Entering information about Customers who are Individuals use
different fields from entering information about Customers who are
Organisations.  

Click on the drop down list in the **Party Type** field and then
depending on whether you want to enter information about a Customer
that is an **Organisation** or a **Person** select the appropriate
Customer Type.

4.  To add a Customer it is necessary to complete the remaining fields
    on the screen. The more complete and accurate the information you
    enter into the system, the better the system will function.

-   Capture the Short / Common or Abbreviated Name in the **Common Name**
	field. This is usually the trading name.

-   Capture the Registered Name in the **Registered Name** field.

-   Enter the Customer's Registration Number in the **Registration
    Number** field.

    This will appear on all Quotes, Orders, Delivery Notes and
    Invoices as required by law.

-   Capture the date on which the Customer's company was registered
    in the **Registration Date** field. For individuals, this would
    be their **Birth Date**.

5.	Enter a Customer specific account folder name in the **Account Folder Name** field. 
	This folder will be used by the system to store communication, proposals, word 
	documents and PDF Files such as **Sales Orders**, **Delivery Notes** and **Invoices** 
	that are created for this Customer in the system.  
	
:::note Customer Directory
The **Customer Directory** needs to be established under **Party Document Folders**.  
This can be setup by selecting **Tools / Directory Setting** :memo: from the main menu.  
It is advisable that this directory is created as a shared folder on your company's Local Area Network.
