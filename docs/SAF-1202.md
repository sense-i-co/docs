The system will display a screen titled **Maintain Customer Profile**.
This screen lists all the companies classified as Customers in the
system. At the top of this screen is a panel consisting of two rows
and the bottom a grid of many rows containing customer information.  

### Customer Search

The top panel is called the "**Search Criteria**" panel and it enables
you to enter partial information about a Customer and then to instruct
the system to find all records that match the information you have
entered.

    Button on the Menu Bar.

    on the screen. The more complete and accurate the information you
    enter into the system, the better the system will function.

    in the **Registration Date** field. For individuals, this would
    be their **Birth Date**.

	This folder will be used by the system to store communication, proposals, word 
	documents and PDF Files such as **Sales Orders**, **Delivery Notes** and **Invoices** 
	that are created for this Customer in the system.  
	
:::note Customer Directory
The **Customer Directory** needs to be established under **Party Document Folders**.
