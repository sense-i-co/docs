## Introduction  

This **step-by-step guide** will show you **how to Define and Configure** the **Email Settings** for your **Company** and **Employees** within the **SEMS** application.  

This task of setting up **Company Email Settings** is typically done by the SEMS System Administrator in your Organisation.  

Email Setup in the SEMS application is important for two reasons:  
1.  These details will be printed on Transaction documents created in the SEMS application _(e.g. Customer documents including Quotes, Sales Orders & Invoices, as well as Supplier documents such as Purchase Orders and Supplier Claim Forms)_  
2.  One-Time-Pins (OTP) can be emailed to, and received by SEMS users _("Forgot Password" & related Login / System accessibility issues)_.

Email configuration details will be required for this process, and can be obtained from your **Email Service Provider**.
