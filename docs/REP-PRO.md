If you replenish to process order prior to scheduling, the system will determine a scheduled date and place the job in the calendar. In order to schedule the jobs yourself, you would need to schedule the items first and then Replenish by generating the Process Orders.

Navigate to Operation \> Schedule Order Items.

Select the department and the Starting date before Searching.

The Calendar will display populated with the existing scheduled items.

1. To add new items, click the **Add Items** button.

Only those outstanding order items(sales or internal) NOT yet on the calendar will be displayed.

The new items now appear both in the calendar and the grid.
