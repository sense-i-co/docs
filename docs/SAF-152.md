3.  Click on the **Purchase Order Receipt** in the list for which you wish to capture an Invoice.

It is a good idea to find the name of the **Supplier** for whom you wish to capture an invoice.  
:::

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-152/image03.png)  

The system will open a screen titled **"Invoices for POREC ###"**. This
screen will show a list of all the Invoices that have been captured
against the selected Purchase Order Receipt.

5.  Click on the **Add** button on the form bar to open the Add Purchase Order Invoice screen.  

The system will display a screen titled **"Purchase Order Invoice - POINV####"**.  

:::note  
This screen will automatically list all of the details that were captured on the Purchase Order Receipt you selected in step 3 above.  
:::  

This screen consists of three parts, the **Header**, the **Detail** and the **Footer**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-152/image05.png)  

The **Header** is displayed at the top of the screen and displays **information about the Supplier**, the transaction numbers, dates, payment terms, delivery address and so on.  

The **Detail** is displayed in the middle of the screen in a worksheet or
grid and **lists each of the individual items** that were delivered by the
Supplier.  

The **Footer** displays the **total value for the order** at the bottom of the screen.  

6.  You need to enter the **Invoice Number** as it appears on the Supplier's Invoice in the **Transaction No.** field.  

Simply overtype the correct Supplier Invoice number in this field.  

7.  You can enter a Reference number in the **Supplier Reference** field, if this invoice is for a specific order.  

**OR** you can leave the reference number the same as it was captured on the Purchase Order Receipt.  

:::note  
The grid at beneath the Order Header lists the **item code**, the **item name** and the **quantity received** for each item as they were captured on the Purchase Order Receipt.  
:::

8.  You need to **check that the quantity** for which you are being invoiced **corresponds** to the quantity that was booked into stock on the **Purchase Order Receipt**.

9.  Once you are satisfied that the quantity for which you are being invoiced matches the quantity that was received, you need to check the **Unit Cost Price** being charged by the supplier.  

:::note  
If you notice a difference, you can change the Unit Price in the grid by typing the correct Unit Price in the **Invoiced** field.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-152/image9.png)  

Click on the **Yes** button on the Confirmation Dialog pop-up screen to override the Unit Price.

11. Check that the **Amount (excl)** on the screen **matches** the Amount Excluding Tax on the **Supplier's Invoice**.  

12. Repeat steps 8 through 11 for each item listed on the screen.  

13. Once you are satisfied that you have captured in the details for the Supplier Invoice correctly on the system, click the **Save** button on the form bar.
