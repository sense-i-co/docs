## Step-by-step Guideline
___

This procedure describes how you can print a set of Daily Task Record
sheet to give to each operator in the factory. The Daily Task Record
sheet is printed on a separate page for each operator and contains a
barcode that is used by the system to identify the operator. Each
sheet consists of a set of rows that define the working periods in the
day.  

As the supervisor of a team gives an operator a Task Barcode Sticker
to indicate the task has been successfully completed, the operator
must then stick the Task Barcode Sticker in the time period when the
task was completed.  

At the end of each day, or at specific times during the day, the Task
Barcode Stickers are scanned into the system to record what tasks have
been completed. This information is used to track progress on a job
and to calculate the productivity of each operator and team.  

To print the **Daily Task Record** sheets on which to record the day's
production you need to perform the following steps...  

1.  Select **Employee** from the Main Menu.  

2.  Then click **Employee List** from the drop-down menu.

lists all of the Employees that have been captured in the system for
your company.

    Print Preview screen.

    their team.
