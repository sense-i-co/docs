There are numerous entry points to initiate replenishment from an order:

- Sales Order Replenishment
 An Active Sales order Replenishes to

  - Internal Order when another department (factory) is the supplier
  - Process Order when this department (factory) makes it
  - Purchase order when the supplier is external to the company. A Buy-out.


- Sales Order Material Replenishment.
 For a factory department, those items which have replenished to a Process order have a corresponding process model which provides the list of materials required to make the item. Once these process orders are ACTIVATED, the raw material quantities are determined and can be replenished.
  - Purchase order for raw materials
