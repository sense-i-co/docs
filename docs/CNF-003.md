## Introduction  

This **step-by-step guide** will show you how to **Add SEMS Users** in the Sense-i system, enabling them to log in to the **SEMS application**.

The first time this screen is accessed by the SEMS System Administrator, only the SEMS System Administrator is displayed in the Grid List.  

Once the SEMS Login Users have been added, this screen will list the Employees, and other indivduals that have login access to the SEMS system.  

### Add New Login User  

1.  Click on the **Add Record** button on the Action Bar.

To add a Login User it is necessary to complete these fields.

3.  Enter the employee's first name in the **First Name** field.  

4.  Enter the employee's surname in the **Last Name** field.  

:::tip  
It is recommended that one of the first Login Users to be added should be an employee (typically in the Human Resources department) responsible for adding and capturing the relevant Employee Profile information for other employee's in the company.  

Refer to the document titled **["Capture Employee Information"](https://sense-i.co/docs/SAF1204)**.  

Once this process has been completed, New Login Users can be added efficiently.  
Employee Codes can be linked to employees listed under the **Employee Code** field in the **_Profile_** TAB of the **Add New Login User** screen.

:::note  
The system automatically displays the **Employee Code**, **Employee Name** and **Employee Email** details as captured in the **["Capture Employee Information"](https://sense-i.co/docs/SAF1204)** process.

Make a note of the **User Code** that you've assigned to this employee - this needs to be communicated to the relevant employee for SEMS login purposes.
