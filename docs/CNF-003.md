## Introduction  

This **step-by-step guide** will show you how to **Add SEMS Users** in the Sense-i system, enabling them to log in to the **SEMS application**.  

The task of **Adding SEMS Login Users** is typically done by the SEMS System Administrator in your Organisation.  

The SEMS System Administrator would also be responsible for issuing Manual One-Time-PINs (**OTP**) for those Employee's / SEMS users that forget their passwords.  

:::important  
Issuing Manual OTPs would only occur under the following conditions:
-   If the Company Outgoing Email configuration has not been setup, OR 
-   where those Employees / SEMS Users do not have an Email address captured in the system.  

For further information on redressing the above conditions, refer to these documents:
-   **["Configure Outgoing Email Settings"](https://sense-i.co/docs/CNFE002)**, and
-   **["Primary & Alternate Email - Employee Profile"](https://sense-i.co/docs/CNFE001#employee-profile)**  

In certain instances SEMS Users / Employees would not use email.  In these instances the issuing of manual OTPs would be required.

The first time this screen is accessed by the SEMS System Administrator, only the SEMS System Administrator is displayed in the Grid List.  

Once the SEMS Login Users have been added, this screen will list the Employees, and other individuals that have login access to the SEMS system.  

### Add New Login User  

1.  Click on the **Add Record** button on the Action Bar.  

![](../static/img/docs/CNF-003/image05.png)

To add a Login User it is necessary to complete these fields.  
:::  

2.  Enter the User Code in the **User Code** field.

:::	

3.  Enter the employee's first name in the **First Name** field.  

4.  Enter the employee's surname in the **Last Name** field.  

:::tip  
It is recommended that one of the first Login Users to be added should be an employee (typically in the Human Resources department) responsible for adding and capturing the relevant Employee Profile information for other employees in the company.  

Refer to the document titled **["Capture Employee Information"](https://sense-i.co/docs/SAF1204)**.  

Once this process has been completed, New Login Users can be added efficiently.  
Employee Codes can be linked to employees listed under the **Employee Code** field in the **_Profile_** TAB of the **Add New Login User** screen.  
:::

:::note  
The system automatically displays the **Employee Code**, **Employee Name** and **Employee Email** details as captured in the **["Capture Employee Information"](https://sense-i.co/docs/SAF1204)** process.

Make a note of the **User Code** that you've assigned to this employee - this needs to be communicated to the relevant employee for SEMS login purposes.

:::  

:::important  
Once the above process has been completed, the new Login User can be provided with his/her **User Name**.  

The following links should also be included in the communication with the Login User / Employee:  

-    **["Download & Install Sense-i Launcher"](https://sense-i.co/docs/DOWNLOAD)**.  

-    **["Using the Sense-i Launcher Application"](https://sense-i.co/docs/LAUNCH)**.  

-    **["Log in & Maintain Password"](https://sense-i.co/docs/SUI001)**.

## Issue Manual OTP  

:::important  
If the Company Outgoing Email configuration has been captured, AND where those Employees / SEMS Users do have a functioning Email address captured in the system, SEMS will automatically generate and email a OTP to the individual when he/she clicks the **Forgot Password** and subsequent **Request One-Time-Pin** buttons.  

Refer to the section **["Forgot Password"](https://sense-i.co/docs/SUI001#forgot-password)** in the document titled **["Log in & Maintain Password"](https://sense-i.co/docs/SUI001)**.  
:::  

Administrators would use this procedure to issue a Manual OTP _(One-Time-Pin)_ when SEMS Users / Employees have forgotten their Login Password.  

This is necessary in those instances where Company Outgoing Email configuration has NOT been setup, and/or SEMS Users / Employees do not use email, or do not have access to their email.  

1.  Click **Security** on the Main Navigation Menu.  

2.  Click **Login User** in the drop-down menu.  

![](../static/img/docs/CNF-003/image18.png)  

The **Login Users** screen is displayed.  

3.  **Select** & **Open** the Login User record row.  

![](../static/img/docs/CNF-003/image19.png)  

The **Login User - _User Code_** screen is displayed.  

4.  Click the **Set OTP** button on the form Action Bar.  

![](../static/img/docs/CNF-003/image20.png)  

The system automatically generates a unique OTP. 

![](../static/img/docs/CNF-003/image21.png)  

:::important  
The One-Time-Pin is only valid for a certain time.  

If the OTP is not used within the time period, the Login User would need to request a new OTP and the above steps would need to be repeated.  
:::

5.  Click the **OK** button to close the Information dialogue box.  

6.  The One-Time-Pin can now be communicated to the SEMS User / Employee.  

7. Click the **Close** button to exit the Login User screen(s).  

**This is the end of this procedure.**
