## Bulk Select and Edit Multiple Records  

Phoenix gives you the ability to **Bulk select**, and then **edit multiple data records** using the **Jobs** function.  

:::note  
The **Jobs** function is available on certain list grid screens where the neccessity to edit muliple data records is important.  

In this example, we will demonstrate how to select multiple Resource Item Types, and then change the attributes of all those Item Types using only a few mouse clicks.  

This efficient method of altering muliple records simultaneously, saves you an appreciable amount of time, as opposed to editing those reords individually.
