If you have accessed this document from the associated Help link in the Sales Order Delivery section of the SEMS application, it is important to add / initiate the **creation of a Delivery Note** by clicking on the relevant **preceding Sales Order record** and then the **Deliver** button on the **Sales Order** screen.  

:::  

## Step-By-Step Guideline
___ 
### Search for Specific Sales Order  

Once the items listed in a Sales Order are ready, the next step is to create a Delivery Note.  

1.  Select the **Customer** option from the Main Navigation Menu.  

2.  Then click on **Sales Order**.

3.  The system will open a screen titled **"Maintain Sales Orders"**.  
    This screen **lists all of the Sales Orders** that have been captured in the system.  
    
    The screen provides a quick and powerful way to keep track of what Sales Orders have been received from the Company's Customers.

2.  Click the **Deliver** button on the **Form Bar**.

3.  The system will display a screen titled **"Delivery Notes for _S0####_"** _(the **Sales Order number** relevant to the specific Sales Order record selected)_.  
 
This screen lists the Delivery Notes _(if any)_ that have previously been captured against the selected Sales Order.

4.  To add the new Delivery Note, click the **Add** button on the **Form Bar**.  

5.  The system will open a screen titled **Sales Delivery Note**, with the Sales Order Delivery Note Number (**- SODN###**) automatically generated by the system.

This screen lists all the details that were captured on the Sales Order, excluding any items that have been delivered in full.  

### Capture Item Quantities to be Delivered  

You will notice the system displays a column called **Qty Outstanding**.  

This column lists the **difference between** the **quantity originally ordered** by the Customer and the **total of all previous Delivery Notes**.

1.  Enter the Quantity that you will be delivering on the Delivery Note
    you are capturing in the **Trx Quantity** Column. Leave the Quantity where no items are being delivered as 0.

2.  Once you have entered all the information for items being delivered, click on the rows that have **0 Trx** _(transaction)_ **Quantity** and then click the **Remove Item** button on the form bar.

The system removes the details of this product from the Delivery Note but leaves the details in place on the Sales Order so that future Delivery Notes can be captured against the outstanding items.  

### Finalise the Delivery Note  

1. Once the Delivery Note has been finalised, click the **Save** button.  

2. Select the **Activate** button to Activate the Delivery Note. Activating a Delivery Note finalises the details of the Delivery Note in the system, prevents future changes and allows you to print a Delivery Note for the Customer to sign.

3. The system will then present a dialog that asks you if you wish to cancel any outstanding items. Normally you would choose **"No"** so that you can deliver any items still outstanding on the Sales Order at a later stage.  
    
:::important  
You should only choose **"Yes"** if the Customer wants to Cancel the remaining items they ordered and does not want you to deliver these in the future.

4. Once the Delivery Note has been finalised, click the **Close** button on the form bar.

5. The system will return you to the Delivery Notes for _Sales Order_ screen.

6. The system will display the details of the Delivery Note you have just captured in the grid.

7. Click on the row that contains the details of the Delivery Note you have captured.  

8. Then click the **Print** button on the form bar.

9. The system will display the standard **Print Preview** screen so that you can then view and print the Delivery Note.

**This is the end of this procedure.**
