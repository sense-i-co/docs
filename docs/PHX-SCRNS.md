3.  Follow the steps in the **["Arrange Screens to View Supplementary Info""](https://sense-i.co/docs/PHXSCREENS#arrange-screens-to-view-supplementary-info)** section above, to resize and position the various windows on the different monitors.

This power feature enables you to access, view and work with a vast amount of information simultaneously.  

##  Docking - the Basics  

A floating window is one that you can freely move by clicking and dragging it, as explained above.  

The Phoenix "Docking" feature enables you to **dock floating windows** by neatly positioning and fixing them in different **fixed locations** within the main Phoenix screen.  

![](../static/img/docs/PHOENIXUI/a-docking.gif)   

To do this:  
1.  Hold down your left-mouse button anywhere in the top bar of the floating window, then  

2.  (While still holding down the mouse button) position the cursor on the desired location of the **Docking Position Control**

:::tip  
Position the cursor (keeping the mouse button down) on the **top** / **right** / **bottom** OR **left** icon of the **Docking Position Control**.  

The system will visually outline the **_potential_ window postion**.  
:::  

3.  Release the mouse button.  

The window will _snap_ into the fixed docked position.  

You can now resize the docked window:  

4.  Hold down the left mouse button on one of the edges, then  

5.  Drag the edge to the desired position / size, and release the mouse button.  

Repeat the steps above to dock (and resize) other floating windows.
