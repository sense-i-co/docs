## Step-By-Step Guideline
___  

1.  Click on the **Supplier** option in the Main Menu.

2.  Click on the **Purchase Order** item on the Drop Down Menu.

The system will open a screen titled "Maintain Purchase Order." This
screen lists all of the Purchase Orders that have already been captured
in the system within the From and To Date specified in the Search Panel.  
Note that you can change the information displayed in this list by
changing the dates and other information in the Search Criteria Panel
above the list of orders.

3.  Click on the Purchase Order in the list for which you wish to
    capture a Receipt.

4.  Click on the Receive button on the Form Bar to view a list of
    receipts for this order.

The system will open a screen titled "Receipts for Purchase Order
Number XYZ." This screen will show a list of all the Purchase Order
Receipts (in other words the previous deliveries by suppliers) that
have been captured for this Purchase Order. If this is the first time
you are receiving materials against this Purchase Order the system
will obviously list no Purchase Order Receipts.

5.  Click on the Add button on the form bar to open the Purchase Order
    Receipt screen.

The system will display a screen titled "Add Purchase Order Receipt."
This screen will automatically list all of the outstanding items
against the Purchase Order you have selected.  

6.  You can enter the Supplier's Delivery Note Number in the Supplier
    Reference field if you wish to keep track of and match the computer
    records to the Supplier's documents.

7.  Note the grid at beneath the Order
    Header lists the item code, the item name and the outstanding
    quantity for each item on the Purchase Order. As you capture
    receipts against this Purchase Order the system will automatically
    update the Outstanding Quantity to make it easy for you to keep
    track of what items your suppliers must deliver.

8.  You will need to check and count the items delivered by your
    supplier and then once you have obtained the correct quantity, enter
    the quantity received in the Quantity column for each item.

9.  When you have completed capturing the quantity of each item
    received, you need to remove items that the supplier has not
    delivered. To do this, click the Remove Item button on the form bar.

10. Once you have completed capturing the details of the receipt, click
    the Close button on the form bar.

11. The system will display a confirmation dialog asking you if you wish
    to activate the Purchase Order Receipt. If you are confident that
    all the information is accurate, click the Yes button.

12. If the supplier's delivery has only partially fulfilled the Purchase
    Order, the system will present a second dialog asking you if you
    wish to Cancel the Outstanding Items. You should only cancel the
    outstanding items if you no longer wish to receive these. If you do
    so, the Purchase Order will be marked as closed and you will not be
    able to capture any future receipts against it. Normally you would
    choose "No."

13. The screen will return you to the Purchase Order Receipt screen and
    list all the receipts that have been captured against the selected
    Purchase Order. Click the Search button on the form bar.

14. To print the Purchase Order Receipt and attach it to the Supplier's
    Delivery Note, click the Print button.

15. If you need to record any notes about the Purchase Order or the
    Receipt, click the Notes button on the form bar.

16. Once you have completed capturing the receipt, click the Close
    button on the form bar.

**This is the end of this procedure.**

<!-- You should now proceed to the Monitor Outstanding Purchase Orders
Procedure to see how the system has updated the list of outstanding
Purchase Orders. -->
