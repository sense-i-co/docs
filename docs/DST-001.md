## Introduction
___ 

This module relates to the workflow used to define **Directory / Folder Settings** relevant to resource items and specific parties.  

In this guideline, we will focus on the process of adding Directory Settings for **Employee Documents** and **Employee Certificates**.  

:::note  
The same procedures should be used when **defining Directory Settings** relevant to other parties - **Customers**, **Suppliers**, **Departments**, and the **Company**.  
:::  

Before adding certificates & documents relevant to employees, there are a few settings (prerequisites) that need to be in place.  

These include;
-   **Directory Settings for Employee Document folders**  

-   **Employee Certificate Folder**  
    The directories and folders above should preferrably shared with relevant colleagues, SEMS users and/or management of the company - this could be a shared **Local Area Network** (LAN) directory or shared **cloud based folders** (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive etc.)  

Once the pre-requisite settings are in place, Certificate records and associated documents can be added for individual employees.

## Step-by-step Guideline
