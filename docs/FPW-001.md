The SEMS system will send you an email with your OTP.  This to the email address as captured in the SEMS application - in this example **\demo@sense-i.co** as displayed in the information dialogue box.

:::note  
If your User Name has not been linked to an email address in the SEMS application, the system will generate a dialogue box asking you to contact your **SEMS System Administrator**, who will then supply you with a manual **One-Time-Pin** (OTP).

Click the [ OK ] button to close the dialogue box.

3. Copy and paste the OTP from the email / or type it directly into the **Enter One-Time-Pin** field.

4.  Then select the **[ Verify ]** button option.  

:::important  
The OTP is valid for a certain time only.

If the One-Time-Pin has expired, you would need to request a new OTP.

8.  Click the **[ Ok ]** button on the Information box confirming your password has been set. 

:::tip  

Activate the Remember Login check box (optional).

This option is recommended if you are the only one using a specific computer which only you have access to.
This option automatically saves your User Name and Password allowing you to simply select [ Login ] on subsequent SEMS application access.
