The Consolidated Stock View for _future dates_ gives **timeous warnings before the stock runs out** allowing one to proactively order (replenish). Viewed both in the past and future it **alerts us to over-supply** which can affect the cash flow in the business.

To detect problems with your stock you could limit the data by filtering to return only records with warnings.

The colour coding gives a visual picture of records with warnings. Three warnings are possible. As a record can conceivable have all 3 states over the full range of dates, the warnings are displayed in the order or urgency shown below.

- Negative Stock (Red)
- Below Target   (Orange)
- Above Maximum  (Purple)

**Negative Stock** is detected if the stock quantity drops below zero. Both **Below Target** and **Above Maximum** states require a **[Stock Target](../docs/STC-TAR.md)** to have been set.

Drill through to the **Detail View** and choose the **Consolidated** Page/Tab to see the breakdown of the data.
