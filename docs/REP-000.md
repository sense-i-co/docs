# Replenishment

Replenishment is the act of placing a supply order for an item in response to the demand for it.

This act can be in direct response to a demand order (sales, internal or a process order's raw material requirement) or be indirectly by monitoring stock levels.

As with any order, we require the Supplier, Quantity; and Due Date to be set.
 Replenish action, therefore, consists of the following

## Steps

1. Determine/Confirm the **supplier** of the item
2. Set the **Quantity** to order
3. **Select** the items to replenish
4. **Generate** the order. (Due date is calculated based on replenish settings.)
5. **Activate** the generated orders (optional)

There are many different screens in Sense-i to view and manage replenishment.
