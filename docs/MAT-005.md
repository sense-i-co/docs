The system will open a screen titled **Process Order Issue**.
This screen lists all the transactions you have created to record what
materials have been issued from the store.  

These transactions are
called Process Order Issues because they record what Materials have
been ISSUED to which PROCESS ORDERS.  

The top three rows of the screen
contain **Search** fields into which you can enter information to search
for specific transactions.  

You could enter a Process Order Issue number in the **POIS** field.
You could set the **From Date** and **To Date** and
list all the transactions recording materials issued that occurred
between these dates. You could enter the **Customer Reference** number in
the Reference field.  

You could also enter a **% symbol** and then type in
a few letters of the material you want to return into the store. For
example, if the material was a Drawer Runner, Model O8818, Matt Black
you would type **"%O8818"** and the system would list all Process Order
Issues that contained this item.

4.  Click on the Process Order Issue that was used to issue the Material
    being returned.  

5.  Click on the **Return Issue** button on the form bar.

Order Issue you selected in step 4 above.
