## Introduction & Overview  
___  

The Product Costing Process contains all the functions you need to define Process Models.  Process Models are a combination of all the definitions required to manufacture a product and provide a service and optionally can include the following information:  
- Process Model Inputs (also known as Bills-of-Material)  
- Process Model Tasks (also known as Task Routings or Work Breakdown Structures)  
- Part Lists  
- Costings  

There are additional functions such as being able to define:  
- Template Process Models (which allow you to easily create variations of products while using a single main Process Model),  
- Blueprints (which allow you to flag parts that are tracked in the Production Process and use these definitions to easily create variations),  
- Advanced Product Costing Formulae (which allow you to set different Mark-ups for different materials and calculate the cost and selling price of products using sophisticated formulae).  

The functions in the Product Costing module can be best described in the following flowchart.

You can access the step-by-step guides and video demonstrations for each function from the list below.  

### Terms: Process & Module  

We use the term "**Process**" to describe the work that must be done in a specific area of your business and the term "**Module**" to refer to the set of functions in the Sense-i software that allows you to perform that work.  

### Background Information  

To better understand the flowchart please read the **Business PowerPoint, Levels of Work,** and **Understanding Function Types** documents. These documents provide essential background information to understanding how the work and information in your business and the Sense-i system is structured.  


:::note

There are several variations of this process, and within each, also several different ways a function or step in the process can be performed. Each industry has a unique set of rules and procedures that implement the best way to achieve a result. While the process flowchart above might look simple, the unique requirements for the industry and for each company are implemented in each of the functions in the Sense-i system.
