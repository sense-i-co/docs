It is normal for some companies to have separate calendars for different departments and divisions within the company.  
Factory calendars for example often differ from calendars that apply
to the retail outlets of the same company.  

### Add Working Calendar  

1.  To add a new calendar to the company's database, click the **Add** button on the Action bar.  

The system will display the **Add Calendar** screen.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-117/image03.png)  

2.  Enter a name to identify the Calendar you are about to create in the **Calendar Name** field.  

3.  Click the drop-down arrow in the **Week Start Day** field, to specify the day on which the week starts.  This is used for calculating totals for payroll.  

4.  Adjust the work day start time by entering the relevant values in the **Day Start time** field.  

5.  If you wish to make provision for Employees who arrive late for work, by adjusting the actual clock-in times - then enter the minute value in the **Round Log Time to nearest (Minute)** field.  

6.  Enter the time allowed for rest-room visits in the **Hygiene Time (Minute)** field.  

7.  If the Calendar you are creating is to be the common calendar used most in the company, check the **Default** option.

8.  Once you have entered the information needed to create a new Working Calendar, click the **Save** button, and then the **Close** button on the form Action bar.  

### Add Working Time Periods  

You will now need to define the details of the **working time periods** within the Calendar.  

1.  Click on the newly created Calendar record row, then  

2.  Click the **Time Details** button on the Action bar.  

The system will open the **Calendar Detail** list screen.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-117/image05.png)  

This screen lists time period detailed information for each day on the calendar.  

:::important  
On initial access, the Calendar Detail list screen will not display any data.  

The next step is to add consecutive work time periods for the entire working day.  
:::  

3. To create a new period, click the **Add** button on the form Action bar.  

The **Add Calendar Detail** screen is displayed.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-117/image06.png)  

This screen enables you to enter detailed information by assigning a Work Period **Name**, **create Work Periods**, with a **start time** and **end time** for each period.  

In addition, for each period you create you need to specify whether the period is a **productive** period and whether the period is **paid** or not.  

4. Enter a name to describe and identify the period in the **Calendar Detail Name** field.  

5.  If you expect Employees who are assigned to this period to do productive work during the period, ensure the check-box in the **Productive** field is set to checked.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-117/image07.png)  

Alternatively, if the period is reserved for preparing for the day, cleaning up, breaks or lunch, then leave the Productive field un-checked.  

6.  If you pay Employees for the time they are at the company during this period, then set the **Paid** field to **Checked** by clicking the check-box in the Paid field.  

![](../static/img/docs/SAF-117/image08.png)  

If not, then leave the Paid field un-checked.  

7. Enter the **Start Time** for the period you are adding to the Calendar.  

:::note  
If the new period follows on from a previous period, your Start Time should be the same as the End Time of the previous period.  
:::  

8. Enter the **End Time** for the period.  

9.  Enter the number of minutes to be applied as a rounding calculation in the **Rounding Rule (Minutes)** field.  

10. Enter the number of minutes extended as the grace period in the **Grace Period (Minutes)** field.  

11. Enter the sequential number of the work session in the **Start Session No** and **End Session No** fields.   

:::note  
If your company adheres to firm and resolute start and end times for each work period, a new work session follows on sequentially from a previous session.  In this case, the _End Session No_ should be the same as the _Start Session No_ for each period, and increase incrementally to that of the previous period.  

If your company has flexible starting times for each work period, then you can to set the **Start Session No** for the 1st Work Period of the day, and the same number in the **End Session No** for the last period of the day.  
:::

### Copy Daily Work Periods  

Once you have entered the working time periods for a specific day, you can copy the details to other day(s) of the week.  If your company follows the same working routine each day, you can then leave them unchanged.  
Alternatively, you can edit the details to depict the differences in periods for each day, e.g. if your Friday work day ends early.
