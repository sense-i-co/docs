-   **Information/data** is stored on a **Microsoft SQL Database**, accessed from  
-   a central computer _(Server)_, known as the **Database Server**, using  
-   **Internet connectivty**.    
-   **Firewall Security**, together with  
-   **Client-Certificate Authentication** and  
-   **Encrypted Username & Password** access protects information flow, to and from the    
-   **SEMS Business Application** tier, which is  
-   presented on the **SEMS Front End program** _(Client)_ installed on each Login Users' **Personal Computer**.  
-   The **Web Application** tier allows HTTPS access over SSL _(Secure Socket Layer)_, which provides data encryption, server authentication, message integrity, and client authentication for a fortified TCP/IP connection.  
-   The Web Application grants public access, authenticated & verified by an **API Rest server**, to register a bonafide individual as web-user, who can send and request information pertinent to the System.
