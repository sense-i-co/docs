## Introduction
___  

Access to **accurate and reliable information**, and access to **a system to
keep track** of what is happening throughout the entire Order Management
Cycle **is key to managing a business effectively**.

That being said, even with access to accurate and reliable
information, **too much information** can lead to **information overload** and
this is an obstacle to being able to manage a business
effectively.  

However, with access to the right information and the right systems it
becomes possible to be extremely effective and efficient in your daily tasks.  

The key to being able to do this is to;  

a)  have **access to accurate and reliable information**, and  

b)  to be able to **arrange, group and sort the information** to help you
quickly narrow in on, and focus on the important decisions and tasks
that must be completed.  

Depending on where we are in the structure of any business and what our
core areas of responsibility are, we will be focusing on one of the seven
key areas of business.  

1.  **Product Market Validation** - Developing and launching a New Product    

2.  **Operations & Order Fulfilment** - Managing the process of fulfilling customer orders  

3.  **Business Development** - Creating relationships with new customers  

4.  **Sales** - Servicing existing customers and securing orders  

5.  **Marketing** - Generating leads for new business  

6.  **Product and Range Development** - Increasing production range  

7.  **Geographic Expansion** - Expanding to new areas  

While the details for managing each of these areas differ, the overall
**techniques for managing** is almost identical and involves using **reports and lists** to **track the activities** that need to be completed and keep the
members in your team **focused** on the day's activities and on **preparing for the activities** for the next few days.  

When working with information about the business there are **two key concepts** or ideas that we need to keep in mind simultaneously;  
1.  The first is related to the **TASK - "Who and What"**.  

2.  The second is related to **PERFORMANCE - "When and the Measure"**.    

Whenever you think about any business or organisational problem the
information you want to look at will be for one of two primary purposes.
We will either want to;  

a.  Understand what is happening and how well things are going for a
specific task, or;  

b.  Decide what to do next, and who should do it and when.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image1.jpg)  

While results are crucially important to any business, without
fulfilling the orders we receive from our customers reliable and on
time, the business will not have any results to measure. So we need to
make sure that we effectively complete each of the tasks for which we
are responsible in the overall chain activities that must be performed
to keep customers happy.  

So the first skill we need to develop when it come to managing our work,
the first thing we need to "know what to do", is the process of managing
the flow and progress of orders in the company.  

To this effectively using the Sense-i System becomes that much easier if
you know;  

a.  What reports to use and  

b.  How to arrange and focus on the information in each report.  

To develop an understanding of what is happening and what must be done
we have to train our minds to ask questions constantly.  

Without asking questions, our minds cannot develop any insight into or
understanding of reality. And when we take decisions without
understanding what is happening and what must be done all we do is
contribute to chaos and stress in other people's lives and cause
problems for our team, the company and our customers.  

So knowing what questions to ask is the first priority, and only once
you know what questions to ask should you be looking at the information
in the report. Also, once you know what questions to ask you will have a
sense of how to group and arrange the information in each report to give
you the answers that you need.  

This document is focused on how you use the reports in the Sense-i
Enterprise Management System to effectively manage the Operations of the
business so that all orders from customers and processed effectively and
delivered correctly and on time.  

## Entities - Overview  

When making decisions about what information you need to work with, it
helps to understand something called "ENTITIES."  

An **"ENTITY"** is an object that exists in the real world.  
Domains relate to things such as;

### Party / Person or Company    

-   Customer  

-   Supplier  

-   Employee  

-   Department  

### Resources / Physical Objects or Services  

-   **Item**, _e.g. a **Product**, **Material** or **Machine**_.

### Transactions 

-   Quote  

-   Order  

-   Delivery Note  

-   Job Card  

-   Receipt  

-   Invoice, and so on.  

## Information Bands & Columns  

In the **Lists** or **Grids** that the system displays on each screen, the system creates an **"Information Band"** that spans several **detail columns**.  

The system creates a heading for a group columns that is called an **"Information Band"**.  The information band spans several **columns**.  

Each BAND has the name of the Entity displayed so that you know what the information in the columns is about.  

And then within each Band the system displays a set of columns that contain
information about the "Entity" represented by the "Band" in which the columns exist.  

For example, the **Customer Entity _(Information Band)_** has three columns, **Customer Code**, **Customer Name** and **Representative Name**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/anim101.gif)   

These columns help you answer questions about a customer that you might
want to know.  

You will notice that underneath the **"Customer Information Band"** there
are columns that contain information that answer each of these
questions.  

For example, the columns displays **data** that relates to each
"Customer" that answer questions such as;  

-   "What is the **Customer Account Code**?",  

-   "What is the **Customer Name**?",  

-   "Who is the **Sales Rep** who handles this customer?".  

The **Record Row Information** displays all information related to each entity in the grid.  

In a similar way, information about another **"Business Object / Entity"** called
**"Item"** is also represented in a **Band** called **"Item Information"** with
**columns** containing detailed data **underneath each column**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image203.png)   

This allows you to answer questions and find **data & information** about each Item
(Product, Material or Machine) such as;  

-   "What is the **Item Type**?".  

-   "What is the **Item Code**?"  

-   "What **Process** produces the Item?"  

-   "What is the **Item Name** _and description_?"  

In exactly the same way the system displays information about addresses
in the **Information Band** with the caption **Address**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image204.png)   

## Information Configuration - Procedure Guideline  

This procedure describes how you can **configure the information** in the
various list screens in the Sense-i system to suit your
**personal preferences** and the needs of each task you perform.

The screens in Sense-i provide us with information that helps us make
the decisions we need to make. There are three things we need to be able
to do in any report. These are;  

**1.  Hide Non-Relevant Information**  

**2.  Filter Information**  

**3.  Group Information**  

### Hiding Non-relevant Information 

At times **some** of the **information** on the screen is **not relevant** to the task we are performing.  

The system allows us to **hide** any **information** that is **not relevant** to what we are doing.  

To hide information that is not relevant to what we are trying to do, we
can do this in **a number of ways**;

We can **hide a specific colum** if you
don't need to see the information related to that column.  **Right-click on the Column Heading** and choose **"Hide"**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/anim03.gif)   

If you don't need to see ANY OF THE INFORMATION related to the **entire band**, **right-click on the Band** itself and choose **"Hide"**.

The system will then **hide the band and all the columns** related to the
entity represented by the band. In this case, the **Customer Information** band and **all columns underneath** the band will be **hidden**.  

Another way to hide information is to keep specific bands showing and only **hide specific columns**.  

To do this, **right-click** anywhere in the **Grid** and then choose **Columns** in the pop-up menu.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image15.jpg)   

The program will display a screen that allows you to **hide** or (if they
are already hidden) **display specific bands & columns**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image16.jpg)   

To hide any column simply click on the **tick / checkbox** to the left of the column
name. The checkbox will be **blank** if the **column is hidden**.  

**To show a column** in the grid, **click the checkbox** so that the **tick is displayed**.  

Once you have selected the columns you wish to view, click the **Save As**
button and then enter the **name of your configured preferences** in the **Custom Name field**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image17.jpg)   

The program will ask you if you want to **save your configured preference** as a **default**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image18.jpg)   

Choose **Yes** if the layout you have created is the layout you want to see
**each time** you open that specific Grid screen.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/anim05.gif)   

The program keeps a list of each of the custom layout configurations you have created, and you can at any time choose to swap from one layout to another.  

To swap between the different layouts, open the **Custom View**
screen, select the layout of choice and click the **List Custom Views** button.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image19.jpg)   

To **change** between **layouts** simply click on the **name of the Layout Configuration** you wish to view and click the **Select / Load** button.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/anim06.gif)   

### Filter Information  

Even after you have grouped the information in the report so that you
can view the transactions by priority, and hidden information you do not
need to see, you might still find the list contains too much
information.  

You can use the **Quick Filter option** to further filter information in the
Grid.  

Let's say that you **only want to see** orders that are **more than 2 days
late**.  

Click on the **drop-down arrow (Top Right Corner)** of the **column heading** that contains the information you wish to filter by, for example **Delivery Variance (days)**.  

The program will display a list of **unique values** that are in the grid
and you can then **check _(tick displayed in checkbox)_** the ones you wish to see.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/anim07.gif)   

The program will **display the values** by which you have **filtered** the
information in the grid at the **bottom of the screen**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image21.jpg)   

You can click on the **drop-down arrow** to swap between any of the filtered
views you have created.  

And you can click the **Customize** button to open a screen in which you can
type **more complex search filters**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/anim08.gif)   


### Grouping Information  

Before we look at an example of how to group the information, we need to
look at two more **Entities or Bands**.  

The first is the entity of **Time** or in the system called **Period Information**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image105.png)   

The second is the "Entity" called "Order". The **information** and details pertaining to an "Order" are displayed in **columns underneath** the "**Order Information Band**."  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image106.png)   

Here you can see the system displays information such as the;  

-   "Order Number"  

-   "Customer Reference information"  

-   "Due Date"  

-   "Status", and so on.  

The **Grouping function** allows you to **effectively sort the information** in the grid so that you can concentrate and focus on dealing
with what is most important.  

Each of the **Entities** allow you to quickly and easily find and group
information using the **Enable Group** function.  

To group information in the grid, simply **_right-click_** the mouse anywhere in the
grid content area and the program will display a small **popup menu**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image5.jpg)   

Click the **Grid Layout** option and then click the **Enable Groups** option.  

When you do this the program will display a **grey bar** above the grid into
which you can **drag any column heading** to arrange the information on your
screen.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/anim10.gif)   

When you are looking at reports to decide what must be processed next,
it is most useful to first group by **Calendar Month**, then by **Due Week**.  

To arrange the report in this way, simply **drag the Calendar Month column** up
into the **grey group by bar** and then **drag the Due Week underneath it**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/anim11.gif)   

When you have done this you should see the following on the screen;  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image8.jpg)   

Then, depending on how you are going to prioritize and follow-up on the
information the report, you can either group by some combination of;  

-   Sales Rep  

-   Customer _(or Supplier)_  

-   Address  

-   Department  

And then finally by  

-   Order Number.  

You might then end up with a grouping of your report as follows:

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image9.jpg)   

Such a report would tell you the following...  

What **orders** are **due** to be delivered in each **month and week**, for each
sales **representative**, in each **suburb** for each **Customer**.  

The program will collapse all the detail so that you can then focus in
on one transaction at a time.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image107.png)   

To zoom in on the details you simply need to click the **+ sign** next to
each record **to see the details**.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/anim12.gif)   

So, as a general rule, when you are looking at reports to decide what
must be processed next, it is most useful to **first group** by **Calendar Month**, **then** by **Due Week**.  

## TAKING ACTION

Once you have filtered and arranged the information in the report you
need to take **action** to move the items in the order to the **next step in the process**.  

You can do this in one of two ways.  

If you are processing the transaction without having to take any action
away from your computer, each **Outstanding Orders List** screen has a
button at the top of the screen that will automatically open and
populate the next transaction you need to create with the information
from the record you have in focus. A record in focus will appear in
yellow.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image22.jpg)   

Or, if you are relying on someone else in the team to take action before
you can create the next transaction in the sequence, then you can Print
a list that they can use as an instruction of what they need to do,
record what they have done and then return the list to you to capture.  

To do that click the **Print** button.  

The program will display a customised follow up list with specific
instructions that the person who is responsible for performing the task
must follow.  

![](../static/img/docs/SUI-003/image23.jpg)   

Remember, that in order for the company to be successful, we all need to
monitor what needs to be done in our area and take the necessary steps
to ensure that each order is processed on time by the end of each
working day.  

Using the Sense-i System in the way described in this document will make
this an easy and efficient action to do.  

**This is the end of the "Working with Lists & Grids" section.**
