## Status - Purchase Order Example
___  

You will notice that the system lists all Purchase Orders in order of **Supplier Name**.  

To make the list useful for tracking any Outstanding Transactions that are due within a specific period (a period between a **From Date** and a **To Date**) the next one or two weeks.  

:::note  
The exact time span will depend on the average lead time of the
delivery from your suppliers and you can in fact set up several
different time spans for different suppliers.  
:::

The first thing that you will need to do is to remove all Purchase
Orders from the list that have already been delivered.  

Each Purchase Order is assigned one of several statuses.

If the Purchase Order is **Still being drafted** then the Status will be **PROVISIONAL**.

If the Purchase Order is **Finalised and sent to the Supplier** then the Status will be **ACTIVE**.

If the Purchase Order is **Cancelled** then the Status will be **CANCELLED**.

If the Purchase Order is **Delivered in Full** then the Status will be **CLOSED**.
