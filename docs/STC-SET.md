:::tip
If you choose to Generate the Target (as opposed to setting it manually)
we need a value for average daily demand.

:::note
Setting the _Average Daily demand by_ _ **Projected demand history** _ requires the projected demand, date range selecting and subsequent filtering be used. The remaining settings are not fed by the underlying values in the grid and can be set at anytime with no regard for stock type or date setting.
