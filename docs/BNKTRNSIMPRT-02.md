## Covert Bank Statement to Excel format  

If your Financial Institution does not offer the facility to download Bank Statements in Excel format, your company would typically receive periodic bank statements in .PDF format.  

The first step in this procedure, is to convert bank statements to Excel format.  

Converting your bank statements to Excel format will allow you to sort and filter the data so that the information can be imported into the SEMS application.  

Converting a PDF bank statement into an Excel file can be accomplished using several methods. The approach you choose depends on the complexity and format of your bank statement. Here are three common methods:

### 1. Manual Copy-Paste _(for Simple PDFs)_:

- Open the PDF bank statement using a PDF viewer like Adobe Acrobat Reader or a web browser.  
- Select the table or text in the PDF that you want to convert.  
- Right-click and choose "Copy" or press Ctrl+C.  
- Open Microsoft Excel.  
- Create a new worksheet.  
- Click on a cell where you want to paste the data.  
- Right-click and choose "Paste" or press Ctrl+V.  
- The data should now be in your Excel sheet.

You will need to adjust formatting as needed.

### 2. PDF to Excel Converter Software:

There are specialized PDF to Excel conversion tools that can automate the process. Some popular ones include **Adobe Acrobat** _(Paid)_, **Nitro Pro** (Paid), and online services like **Smallpdf**, **ILovePDF**, or **PDF2Go**.  

Here's how to use one of these tools:  
- Install or access the PDF to Excel conversion software or website.  
- Upload your PDF bank statement.  
- Select the conversion format (Excel).  
- Start the conversion process.  
- Once the conversion is complete, download the Excel file.  

### 3. Adobe Acrobat (Text Recognition):  

If your bank statement is a scanned image or has non-selectable text, **Adobe Acrobat Pro** provides OCR _(Optical Character Recognition)_ functionality to recognize text and convert it to Excel.  

Here's how:  
- Open the PDF in **Adobe Acrobat Pro** _(requires a subscription or trial)_.  
- Go to "File" > "Save As" > "Spreadsheet" > "Microsoft Excel Workbook".  
- Follow the prompts to adjust settings and save the converted file.  

Please note that the success of PDF to Excel conversion depends on the quality of the PDF, the accuracy of OCR, and the formatting of the original PDF document.  

:::important  
Regardless of the method used to convert the PDF to excel format, you will need to clean up and format the data in the resulting Excel after conversion.  

This is described in the document titled **["Excel Bank Statement Preprocessing"](https://sense-i.co/docs/BNKTRNSIMPRT03)**.
