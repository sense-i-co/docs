## Introduction  

You would use this procedure whenever you wanted to create a new
Internal Order from one Department for products or services provided by
another Department.  

:::note  
There are two ways Internal Orders can be created between the
departments in a company.  

The one is a **Manual Internal Order** (which is covered by this document), the other is via the **Replenish Function**, which is covered by
**[Create Finished Goods Plan](REP001)**.  
:::

1.  Click on the **Orders** bar on the Main Navigation Menu at the top
    of the screen.

2.  Then select **Internal Order** option from the Drop-down Menu.

## Search  

This screen lists all the Internal Orders that have already been
captured in the system within the ***From Date*** and ***To Date***
specified in the Search Criteria Panel.

## Add New Internal Order 

1.  Click on the **Add** button on the Form Bar to open an Add New Internal
    Order form.

the products or services that you want to include in the Internal Order
you are preparing.

This is the department or branch for whom you are capturing the Internal
Order, the **Customer Department**.

2.  Use the drop-down button in the **"Owner Dept."** field.

3.  The system will open a screen just below the department field called
    **Select Department**. This screen enables you to select a specific
    department or branch from a list of all the departments / branches
    defined for the company.
	
![](../static/img/docs/INO-001/image4.jpg)  

Click on the **name of the department** you wish to use as the Customer
Department.

remaining information about the Internal Order before you select the
specific products or services that you wish to include on the order.

You need to enter information such as the;

### Due Date 

The due date is the date (and optionally time, depending on how the
departments in your company arrange deliveries) by which the products
for which you have quoted need to arrive at the specified department's
location.  

9.  To set the Due Date, simply click on the required date from
the pop-up date control displayed under the **Due Date** field.
	
![](../static/img/docs/INO-001/image6.jpg)  

:::note

You can adjust this at any stage with the **Adjust Due Date** function
if this changes.

:::

### Shipping date 

The Shipping Date is the date by which the items for which you have
quoted must be despatched.

This is normally calculated by deducting the Shipping Duration and any
buffer times allowed as a safety margin, from the Due Date above.

10. To set the **Shipping Date**, simply click on the required date from the pop-up date control displayed under the **Due Date** field.

:::note

This too can be changed at any time with the
**Adjust Shipping Date** function.

### Payment Terms 

The Payment Terms will determine how the customer department will need
to pay for the products or services for which you have orders.

As a default, each Department is assigned a payment term which is
applied to their account.

11. To change the payment terms for a specific transaction, click the
**down arrow** in the **Terms** field.

The system will display a list of available payment terms from which you
can select the appropriate payment terms you wish to apply to the
transaction you are creating.

## Status - Activate / Deactivate

For more information on how transaction Statuses work in the Sense-I program please refer to the document titled 
**Understanding Status in Sense-i**.  

All information that is captured by users in the Sense-i has a status and the first time a record is captured this 
Status is set as Provisional.  

A Provisional record means it is still being entered and not complete, in effect, in _draft_ mode and as a result 
"Provisional" records can be modified at any time.  

Once the details of any piece of information (whether this is a **party** such a customer, supplier, employee, a 
**resource** such as a material, component, machine or product, or a **transaction** of any sort), the details can be 
protected from change by setting the status of the record to “Active”.  

Active records mean that they are considered as reliable information that anyone else in the company can use. 
Active records cannot be changed and this prevents mistakes from being introduced to information that is considered to 
be complete, accurate and reliable.  

However, there is a need in some cases to be able to change a record that has been marked as Active.  
This could be either because the record was activated by mistake before being finally checked, or because 
reality has changed and information needs to be updated.  

When a record in Sense-i is still in “provisional” state, the button to control the status of the read has the 
caption **"Activate"**.

![](../static/img/docs/INO-001/image14.jpg)  

:::note
You can see in the image above, when the record is in Provisional status, the Status button at the top of the screen will 
allow you to mark is as finalised by changing it to Active.
:::

To change the status of a provisional record to active, click on the record in the list and click the **Activate** button 
at the top of the screen.  

When a record has been Activated (but only if no subsequent transactions have been captured against it), it is 
possible to change the status to Inactive so that you can edit the record as necessary.

![](../static/img/docs/INO-001/image15.png)  

You can see in the image above, when the record is in Active status, the Status button at the top of the screen will 
allow you to Deactivate the record so that you can change it, but only if no subsequent transaction has been created.  

To change the status of a active record to provisional or inactive so that you can edit the record, click on the 
record in the list and click the **Deactivate** button at the top of the screen.  
The program will change the status of the record and you can then make the necessary changes.  

Once you have edited a record, you can set its status to Active again by clicking the **Activate** button at the top of 
the form.

:::note
Remember that the status of a record can only be changed from **Active**, **Cancelled** or **Closed** if no subsequent 
documents were created from it.
:::

---
## Open  

You can view the details of any record or transaction in the system if you have security permission to do so.  

To open or view a record, simply click on the row in the grid that contains the name or number of the record you 
wish to view and then click the ![](../static/img/docs/button/but-open2.png) button at the top of the form.

---
## Copy  

With some records and transactions you can use an existing record to create a new record though the copy function.  

To copy one Internal Order and create a new Internal Order from it, you should find the Internal Order you wish to use as the 
source document, click on the record for this Internal Order in the grid and the click the ![](../static/img/docs/button/but-copy2.png) button at the top of 
the form.

![](../static/img/docs/INO-001/image16.png)  

The program will display a form that will allow you to enter certain key information that is required for a copy, 
for example the **Due Date**.

![](../static/img/docs/INO-001/image17.png)  

Once you have completed this form, click the ![](../static/img/docs/button/but-save.png) button at the top of the form.  

The program will then create the copy of the original document you selected and it will set the status of the 
copied document to Provisional so that you can edit the transaction as required.  

---
## Cancel Outstanding  

Remember from the introductory training to Sense-i that all transactions (except the final transaction in a sequence, 
or _**Transaction Stream**_) follows in a set sequence.  

So for example a Sales Opportunity becomes a Quote, which can in turn becomes an Internal Order, which in turn becomes 
a Internal Order Delivery Note and finally a Internal Order Invoice.  

Because each transaction represents either the request for some work to be done (such as make or deliver a product) 
or records the actual work being done (for example an actual delivery), it is possible that the quantity on one document 
is not completely fulfilled by the subsequent transaction.  

So a department may order 10 chairs, but the first delivery might only be for 8 chairs because 10 chairs are not available.  

When this happens, it is possible to either leave the original order open (meaning that the shortfall must still be 
delivered), or if the outstanding balance is no longer required, then you can change the status of the transaction 
by clicking the **Cancel Outstanding** button at the top of the form.  

This will set the status of the selected transaction you have cancelled to "Closed" or "Cancelled".  

If a transaction has been partially fulfilled and you choose to Cancel Outstanding, then the status of the transaction 
will be set to Closed.  

If a transaction has not been fulfilled at all and you choose to Cancel Outstanding, then the status of the transaction 
will be set to Cancelled.  

---
## Notes  
You can add notes to any party, any item or any transaction in the Sense-i program and share these notes with users in the 
company.  

:::tip Using Notes
For more information on working with notes in Sense-i refer to the document titled **[Using Notes In Sense-i](1218)**.

**This is the end of this procedure.**
