:::note Terms: Process & Module

We use the term "**Process**" to describe the work that must be done in a specific area of your business
and the term "**Module**" to refer to the set of functions in the Sense-i software that allows you to perform
that work.  

:::

:::note background information
To better understand the flowchart please read the **Business PowerPoint, Levels of Work,** and
**Understanding Function Types** documents. These documents provide essential background information
to understanding how the work and information in your business and the Sense-i system is structured.

:::  

:::note

There are several variations of this process, and within each, also several different ways a function or
step in the process can be performed. Each industry has a unique set of rules and procedures that
implement the best way to achieve a result. While the process flowchart above might look simple, the
unique requirements for the industry and for each company are implemented in each of
the functions in the Sense-i system.
