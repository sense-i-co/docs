6.  Choose the **Department** in which you are going to create the Process Model.  
    Normally, for products that your company sells this will be the "Production" department.  

7.  Define on which rows in your source Excel Spreadsheet the Column Headings appear and on which row the first data record appears.  

In the following illustration as an example, the column headings appear on Row 2 and the Data begins on Row 4.

In this example the column headings appear in Row 1 and the data starts in Row 2.

11. The program will show the list of all the columns in your source spreadsheet in the **Column Description** column, and the Sense-i column required in the **Sense-i Column Name** column.  

12. The grid will also show you what kind of information is required in each column and what is required.

16. Click the **Upload** button to load the information. Note that at this point it has not been saved to the database.  

17. A list of errors will appear.  

For example, if the information is missing the error will read:  
**"Data is required."**

If the material code on your spreadsheet does not match an EXISTING material code in the database in will display the message **"Material Code not found."**  

In this case you will need to go to the Supplier Catalogue and load the material before you can continue.  

The full list of error codes is displayed below.

18. To save the information in the grid against each product, in other words to create a list of Process Model Inputs automatically from the source data you have loaded in the grid, click the **Import** button.  

19. Then go to the Process Model screen and open the Process Model to check the inputs are correct, and activate the Process Model.  

20. Finally, go to the Sales Order for which you have defined the materials and click the Materials Tab. The program will display a list of all materials required to produce each product in your sales order.  

**This is the end of this procedure.**
