10. You will immediately notice that the Process Model Module consists of a set of 8 tabbed worksheets. Each of these worksheets enable you to define specific information needed to calculate the cost of the Product and to plan Labour and Materials Requirements once Orders are received from Customers.  

11. The Profile Worksheet enables you to enter general information about a Process Module such as its Name and the Department that is responsible for running the Process. Whenever you enter the Process Model Module from the Product Catalogue, the system will automatically create a Name, assign a Department and complete the other fields on the screen.  

12. If you need to enter a description or notes, you can type these in directly in the Description and Notes fields.  

13. Once you have completed the Profile Screen for a Process Model you will then need to enter information about the Materials Required on the Inputs Screen, the Tasks that need to be performed when running the Process on the Tasks Screen and the Parts which make up the Product in the Part List Screen.  

Please refer to the other Standard Operating Procedures in the Process Model Module documentation for information on how to enter this information.  

**This is the end of this procedure.**
