-   a Grid of many rows containing employee information at the bottom called the **Employee List Grid**  

:::important  
On opening the **Employee List** screen, **all** employees and contractors are displayed.  The **(All)** button in the **Alphabetical Selection Panel** is active.

## Add Employee  

This procedure describes how to add the names of new employees and their details to the Sense-i Enterprise Management System.

The right hand section contains the fields for the primary **Contact** details.
