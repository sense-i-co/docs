## Introduction  

This **step-by-step guide** will show you **how to log Tasks** the **Sense-i Job Tracker** application.  

:::important  
Before a user can log into the Job Tracker application, make sure that the user is defined as an Employee and User in the database.  

Refer to the document titled **["Add SEMS Users"](https://sense-i.co/docs/CNF003)**.  
:::  

Once the User has been set up on the system, and the **[Job Tracker application has been installed](https://sense-i.co/docs/JOBTRCK01)** on their device, open the Job Tracker application.  

The system will display the Job Tracker login screen.

## Enter Login Credentials  

1.  Type the User Code in the **User Code** field.  

:::important  
If this is the first time you are logging into the application, the System Administrator will need to generate a One-Time-Pin (OTP) in the main SEMS application.  
:::  

Once the OTP has been generated, and you have received it from the System Administrator,  

2. Click the **Forgot Password** button.

6.  Enter your password in the **Password** field.  

::::important[Remember Password - Optional]  
You can choose to activate the **Remember** check box.  

This option is recommended if you are the only one using a specific device which only you have access to.  
This option automatically saves your **User Name** and **Password** allowing you to simply select [ Login ] on subsequent Job Tracker application access.  
:::warning  
**Do NOT** activate the **Remember** check-box if the device is shared with other users.  
:::  
::::  

7.  Click the **Login** button.  

The system will display the Job Tracker **Home** screen.  

![](../static/img/docs/JOB-TRCK/image25.png)  

This screen shows you the performance details for the **Day**, the **Week** and a summary in the **Profile** section.

3.  Click the **Task Code** field to display a list of Task Codes that are linked to your profile.  

4.  Click on the **Task Code** that describes the task you are going to perform.  

:::note

The system will display the **name of the Task** you have selected in the **Task Code** field.

5.  Scan / Enter the **Barcode** from the Job Card you are working on.  

:::info  
This would either be from a **Job Card** that has the Barcode, or a **part label** barcode attached to the part you are working on.  

![](../static/img/docs/JOB-TRCK/image29.png)  

:::  

The system will display the details of the job for the Barcode you entered on the Task Scan window, and the **Start** button will be enabled.

6.  Click the **Start** button.  

![](../static/img/docs/JOB-TRCK/image31.png)  

As you work to complete the task, the system will display the **Actual Time** taken in the **Actual** field, the **% complete** in the circle, and the **remaining time** at the bottom of the screen.

When the task has completed:

7.  Click the **Stop** button.

The system will display the Result screen.  

If the task was completed **within the target time set**, the system will display a **successful** result screen.

![](../static/img/docs/JOB-TRCK/image32.png)  

If the task has taken **significantly longer** than the expected Target Time, then the system will display an **unsuccessful result** screen.

8.  To continue, click the **Next Job** button and repeat the process.  

We will now refer back to the **["Target Bonus Minute Rules"](https://sense-i.co/docs/BONUSRULE01)** procedure, in which you set the **Target Recovered Productive Time**.  

This value is used to determine the point at which **Bonuses are displayed** on the screen. 

![](../static/img/docs/BONUSRULE-01/image02.png)  

The employee / login user, needs to chase the **Target Recovered Productive Time** value.  
In other words, the **sum total of all the Target Times** for the tasks they have completed for the day needs to **match** or **exceed** the **Target Recovered Productive Time** value.  

Once it does, the Task Scan screen will begin to display the value of the bonus they have earned.
